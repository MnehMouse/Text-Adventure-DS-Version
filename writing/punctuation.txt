In order to ease testing of delay_print, this will attempt to use commas, periods, and other punctuation- to make this also test those delays (Although such punctation might not be written, it would still be good to include them; After all, it is better not to have to add to the test later)- without too many newlines. Fortunately, I can try to use the punctuation well: I've already included commas, dashes, parentheses, a semicolon, a period, and now a colon. But! I have yet to add a question mark, which would also be important, right? And now for the text to distinguish from the newline.
