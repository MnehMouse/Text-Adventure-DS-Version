#shops could be in villages and other devoloped areas. 
#properties a shop might have
#Items sold, associated with prices (maybe they vary from shop to shop, or a shop has a discount multiplier)
#One of the parameters could be an array of Items (which would have a price accossiated with it cause price is a parameter of the Items class)
#This class will also probably contain a toString method as well as a way to purchase items?
#Also, will shops have limits on how much of each item it has? If so, there could be a dictionary instead of an array (like dicitonary would have Item: # of times)
